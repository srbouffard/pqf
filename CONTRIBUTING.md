# Contributing to PQF

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 22+
- `gh` CLI (authenticated: `gh auth login`)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var (for scoring locally)
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env var (for documentation scorer)

---

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srbouffard/pqf.git
cd pqf
make install-all   # Python deps + Node deps
```

---

## Running tests

```bash
make test          # Python unit tests (110 tests, ~2s)
make test-ui       # Vitest UI unit tests
make test-all      # Both
make lint          # Python ruff lint
make format        # Auto-format Python
```

The CI runs these same commands — if it passes locally, it will pass in CI.

---

## Running the UI locally

```bash
make dev           # Starts Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
```

The UI reads `public/portfolio.json` at startup. To see real data, the file is already present in the repo (regenerated nightly by GHA). You don't need to run the scorers to develop the UI.

## What's auto-generated vs manually maintained

| File / Directory | Maintained by | Edit? |
|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| `products/*.yaml` | PE team, PR-reviewed | ✅ Yes |
| `config/dimensions.yaml` | Contributors, PR-reviewed | ✅ Yes |
| `computed/*.json` | GHA nightly scorer | ❌ Never |
| `public/portfolio.json` | GHA nightly scorer | ❌ Never |
| `public/badges/` | GHA nightly scorer | ❌ Never |
| `drift-history.json` | GHA drift tracker | ❌ Never |

## PR workflow

1. **Branch:** `feat/my-feature` or `fix/my-fix` (no ticket prefix required)
2. **Commits:** Conventional Commits — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
3. **PR title:** Mirrors your commit subject (the CI enforces nothing, but reviewers appreciate consistency)
4. **CI checks:** Python lint, Python tests, UI tests, security audit — all must pass

## Adding a product

See [docs/adding-a-product.md](docs/adding-a-product.md).

## Adding a quality dimension / scorer

See [docs/adding-a-dimension.md](docs/adding-a-dimension.md).

---

## Code style

**Python:** `ruff` for linting and formatting. Config in `pyproject.toml`. Line length 100, target Python 3.11+.

```bash
make lint          # Check
make format        # Fix
```

**TypeScript:** ESLint via Vite. Run with:
```bash
cd ui && npm run lint
```

No Tailwind, no shadcn. All UI components use `@canonical/react-components` (Vanilla Framework wrappers).
